Purpose: Project for UNT CSCE 3220, Human Computer Interfaces

Description: Program that allows users to join fitness or nutrition challenges on their own or join an organization to follow them. The app will measure progress and encourage users on their health and fitness journey!

To use this program, you will need to download MongoDB and Flask.

The system is not currently populated with challenges, so all challenges visible will be ones that you have added as a user. You must register before logging in.
